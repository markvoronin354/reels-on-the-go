- **`MediaButtonService`**: Foreground service holding `MediaSession` and AudioFocus to capture Bluetooth AVRCP commands from car head units.
- **`ShizukuManager`**: Executes privileged ADB shell commands (`input swipe`) when authorized via Shizuku/Shevery or Root (`su`).
- **`PreferencesRepository`**: Stores app settings and package selections using `SharedPreferences`.
